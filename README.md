Timing green flashes in video

Thanks to `openCV` and `PIL` and `imageio` for making this work :)

## Dependencies
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install pillow`
`pip install imageio`
`pip install csv`
*(I know, a lot)*


All output frames are saved into `/images` to prevent clutter and from killing my VSCode IDE.

Todo:
- [ ] figure out how to give exact time when the flash is multiple frames wide
- [ ] reduce computation requirements -- be more efficient
