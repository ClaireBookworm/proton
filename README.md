Timing green flashes in video

Thanks to `openCV` and `PIL` and `imageio` for making this work :)

python.py is the actual document (I know, creative name but I had too many python files and I don't want to type `python final-code-to-use.py` in the terminal every time) and still working on timestamps.

All output frames are saved into `/images` to prevent clutter and from killing my VSCode IDE.

Todo:
- [ ] figure out how to give exact time when the flash is multiple frames wide
- [ ] reduce computation requirements -- be more efficient
