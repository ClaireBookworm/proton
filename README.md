## Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/ClaireBookworm/proton.git`
Wait for the code to download, and make sure you have python3.
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
This downloads all the packages needed. *Please* make sure you're using python3 and you have the correct version of `pip3` installed. 

To check if you have the correct version of pip3 run `pip3 install --upgrade pip`, and if you have the version `19.3.1`, you've got the right version!

Then, just do `python3 python.py` and input the file name w/ the extension (probably should be .mp4) and the length of the video. Also, input the time between green flashes in order to speed up the timing processes. 

(If you don't have Python3, you can do `python oldPy.py` instead, this code if for python 2 but wouldn't be as fast...)

Todo:
- [ ] make sure opencv-python works on everything
